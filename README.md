## Features
- Adds a drop-down menu to each breadcrumb (using jQuery UI), containing the sibling and child forums.
- Triggers on mouse-enter, no clicks required (this keeps the breadcrumbs working as normal when clicking on them).
- Auto-hide when the user moves the cursor outside of the menu. 

#### Requirements
- phpBB 3.1-RC1 or higher
- PHP 5.3.3 or higher

#### Languages supported
- No language files included/necessary

#### To do list
- Improve responsiveness and touch-events
- Perhaps make an ACP module so admins can set certain vars (such as animations and timers).
